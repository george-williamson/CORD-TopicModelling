# CORD-TopicModelling
Here is an example of using Latent Dirichlet Analysis to build a topic model on the [Covid-19 Open Research Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge). I used PySpark to implement LDA and compared a Batch vs Online solution to the problem.

**To inspect the notebook it is reccomended to download the .ipynb file locall due to the large amounts of data in some of the queries.**

I submitted this as part of my Distributed Computing for Big Data course at LSE.
